    <h1>Alide (Aliide)</h1>
    <p>
        Alide's parents Madis and Maarja Noone originated from Estonia. Like many others they migrated across an open border to neighbouring Russia to farm land near the town of Gatchina, a satellite town of St Petersburg.

    <p>
        My father clearly recalled his mother reminiscing about her stay across the border in Estonia. 
        Alide stayed with family in Estonia whilst she developed skills as a seamstress. 
        Albert was able to recall his mother's wish to return to Estonia.   </p>
