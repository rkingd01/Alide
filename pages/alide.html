    <h1>Alide (Aliide)</h1>
    <p>
        Alide's parents Madis and Maarja Noone originated from Estonia. They migrated across an open border to neighbouring Russia to farm land near the town of Gatchina, a satellite town of St Petersburg.

        Alide stayed with family in Estonia whilst she developed skills as a seamstress. 
       Albert was able to recall his mother's fondness for her time in Estonia.   </p>
